# Intruder-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
An intruder detection system was developed for crop fields using a deep convolutional neural network

Objective:
  Develop an intruder detection system for crop fields using image recognition and computer vision. If an intruder is detected, a mail should be sent to the owner notifying what kind of intruder(animal or human). If animal, then blow some sound to shoo it away. If human, then report with urgency.
  
Features Implemented:
   Collecting Dataset of crop fields and cattle - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEtiibJ2jpM
   Training a suitable classifier - Keras/TF model
   e-mailing system - Done
